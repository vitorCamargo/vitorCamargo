Why so many code if life is not programmed and there is no logic in the best things.
But, besides that, don't copy this READ.me, I made it!

I'm still a Computer science student whos is absolutly passionate for front-end development, loving creating solutions for user's demand, elevating a software as much as possible. I can create a system for complete (as full-stack), but I have a majority understanding in front-end technologies and frameworks, such as, ReacJS, VueJS, pure HTML/JS/CSS interfaces and PHP. But lately, I've been working on Devops stuffs and loving it 🥰.
